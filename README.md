This is a non-TDD object oriented approach to Uncle Bob's bowling game kata.

It took about 2-3 hours including looking up some Kotlin stuff as I'm fairly new to it.

Note that I did intentionally have the main function only call roll with the same argument as in the kata.

I intend to use this in comparisons of TDD to waterfall.
